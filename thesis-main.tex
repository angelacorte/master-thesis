\begin{abstract}
    The integration of technology in everyday activities is rising, with objects being increasingly equipped with
    computational capabilities and interconnected to form the Internet of Things, leading to the need for
    innovative cyber-physical services capable of creating a fast bridge between the real and virtual world.

    The central idea of this thesis focuses on leveraging Kotlin Multi-Platform to enhance aggregate computing based on
    XC principles, addressing challenges in developing versatile solutions across different environments,
    with the need of efficient and scalable applications operating from cloud to edge to mesh networks.

    This thesis combines theoretical analysis, software development, and performance evaluation to assess
    the effectiveness of the objective, demonstrating versatility and efficiency.
    There is a notable improvement in performance, scalability, and adaptability across in different network environments.
    With the proposed approach, the developed solution appears to be more efficient and effective in addressing
    complex challenges within systems rather than the current state of the art.
    The results demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology, suggesting that it can lead to
    more efficient and versatile service development.

    In summary, this thesis shows that integrating Kotlin multi-platform in aggregate computing, based on XC principles,
    enhances service development.
    Improved performance and scalability are emphasised through this approach, which opens doors for more efficient and
    adaptable solutions.
    Future exploration and improvement of this technology has the potential to advance interconnected systems and innovations.
    This study connects physical and virtual realms, setting the stage for future developments that could improve service
    efficiency and effectiveness.
