\frontmatter\frontispiece

\begin{abstract}
    The integration of technology in everyday activities is increasing, with objects being increasingly equipped with
    computational capabilities and interconnected to form the Internet of Things.
    Within these systems, different software components, and not necessarily only one per device, interact with each other
    to build innovative cyber-physical services (i.e., capable of creating a bridge between the real and virtual world).

    The solution that has the most success at the moment involves the use of Cloud Computing.
    This, although it provides virtualized resources on a large scale, has limits in terms of latency (due to the physical
    distance between machines) and scalability (due to centralization): for this reason, there is the aim to bring resources
    closer to the outer edge of the network, where, however, problems of interoperability between devices and complexity
    in the management of distributed resources increase.
    The design of applications capable of operating indistinctly on the cloud, on the edge, or even on a mesh network
    (in fact, on a computational continuum that goes from the edge to the cloud) can benefit from unconventional approaches,
    such as Aggregate Computing.

    In this context, the \emph{Collektive} project is proposed as a Domain-Specific Language for programming aggregate computing
    systems, based on Kotlin, a modern and multi-platform programming language.
    The main goal of this thesis is to enhance the \emph{Collektive} DSL, leveraging the principles of XC to improve the performance of the DSL,
    developing a multi-platform implementation of the DSL with kotlin-multiplatform, to allow the execution of the aggregate programs on different platforms.
    This enhancement was pursued to ensure its competitiveness against existing solutions and to enhance its usability.
