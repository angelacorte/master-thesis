In this chapter, will be presented the main contributions of this thesis.

\section{Collektive}
\label{sec:collektive}

\emph{Collektive} is a framework designed to simplify the definition of \ac{ac} systems.

The main objective of this technology is to facilitate the development of aggregate programs that can be executed on a
variety of computing systems, such as mobile and wearable devices, computers, and the cloud.
This allows for interoperability and communication between these systems, despite their different nature.

To achieve this, \emph{Collektive} uses the \ac{fc} model to provide a straightforward and intuitive method for defining
an aggregate program, without the need for low-level coding.

\section{XC in Collektive}
\label{sec:exchange-in-collektive}

Thanks to the design of \textbf{XC}, it is possible to implement the methods proposed by \emph{field calculus}
(~\ref{par:syntax-of-field-calculus}) in terms of \emph{exchange} ~\ref{par:communication-in-xc}.
This allows for a more efficient and flexible communication system, as it is possible to decide to send messages only to
specific nodes, without having to send them to all nodes in the system.


\section{DSL}
\label{sec:dsl}

%message modelling (in scafi there is an action that computes the messages and then creates a reaction that
%sends the message) we do it in a different way

\paragraph{Architecture}

\paragraph{Syntax}
%code
%rep non serve farla con xc perche non vogliamo che gli altri nodi ricevano il messaggio, cose che non gli interessano
