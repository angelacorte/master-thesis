Write your intro here.
\sidenote{Add sidenotes in this way. They are named after the author of the thesis}

You can use acronyms that your defined previously,
such as \ac{IoT}.
%
If you use acronyms twice,
they will be written in full only once
(indeed, you can mention the \ac{IoT} now without it being fully explained).
%
In some cases, you may need a plural form of the acronym.
%
For instance,
that you are discussing \acp{vm},
you may need both \ac{vm} and \acp{vm}.
